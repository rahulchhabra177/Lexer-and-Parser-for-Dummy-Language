First execute the lex file by typing ml-lex boolean.lex in terminal.
Then execute the yacc file by typing ml-yacc boolean.yacc in terminal.
To run the code we just need to go into the sml environment (by using rlwrap sml command in the terminal)
In the sml environment we need to write (use "loader.sml") without parentheses which will load all the files.
 We can use now the parseString function which takes parameter the path of file need to be parsed.
Say the name of file is f so we will write parseString "f" in the terminal if file is in the same directory and if file is in diffrent directory we will write the path in the inverted commas.
